# PhysicsEngine
A physics engine written in c++ from some time ago.


This works on my computer, but is not tested elsewhere. You need SDL2 installed for the SDL library to work (also built by me). All other libraries should be taken care of by the cmakes.


I will probably not update this further, unless I have a need for it.
